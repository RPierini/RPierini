- 👋 Hi, I’m Rodrigo Pierini, also known as @RPierini. I work @ [CPQBA](https://site.cpqba.unicamp.br/) from UNICAMP as a network analyst and system administrator and I am currently finishing my dissertation for my Msc program @ [FEEC](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/)/UNICAMP!
- 👀 I’m interested in network programmability, 5G services and infrastructure, system and services automation, IoT, cryptography, information security and cloud services in general! I like to make things better and more efficient, trying to solve challenging issues in my area of interest and improving my technical skills! The best way to learn something is teaching it, but the second best way is trying to do things by yourself!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about networking programmability with P4 and eBPF, system automation with python and general programming skills
- 👨‍🏫 I like teaching and lecturing in my areas of interest. I'm working hard for a master and doctorate degrees to become a teacher at an university. This is my personal goal in life.
- 🧱 I usually program in Shell Script (BaSH) and Python. I used to program in C, Pascal/Delphi and Java, but haven't done anything in those languages since around 2013. Programming is not my personal favorite subject, but it's an important part in anything related to I.T., specially if you want to develop something new or solve a recurring problem. I'm way more interested in computer networking 😄
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of interest
- 📫 You can reach me through my github account @RPierini
